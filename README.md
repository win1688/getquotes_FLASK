# getquotes_FLASK
Title : Get favourite COINS/TOKEN quotes from CMC.

This script creates a webserver to display my/your favourites 
crypto coins/token from CoinMarketCAP.

You will need to get your own API-KEY from https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/signup/ and input into 
a .env file to run this script to get the quotes from CMC

To get the quotes of your favourite coins edit queryCMC.py

function :- getCMCquotesRESTapi()

	querycoins = { 
    	           'symbol':'LTC,CAKE,BNB,CRO,DFI,BTC,MATIC' }

Roadmap: Release 2.0 to get user input for favourite coins
